# Nostalgia-Trip

WIP Modpack that tries to emulate the feeling of playing older modded minecraft (<1.4.7) with mods like IC2-Classic, Vintage-GT, ProjectRed, Buildcraft, ProjectE and much more, similar to tekkit but also trying to create a modpack that is structured more like newer modpacks, with visible progression and not having endgame gear after a couple of hours of gameplay.
----------
Keep in mind that this is my first time trying to actually do a minecraft modpack properly, not just throwing random mods together.
